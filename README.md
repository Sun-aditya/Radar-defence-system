## ðŸ“¦ Features

- ðŸš¨ **Distance-based LED & Buzzer Alerts**
  - Green LED: Safe Zone
  - Yellow LED: Caution Zone
  - Red LED + Buzzer: Danger Zone (object < critical distance)

- ðŸ“ˆ **Real-Time Radar Scanning Visualization**
  - Graphical sweep display with the closest object highlighted
  - Flashing ring animation for the closest object

- ðŸ“² **Instant Telegram Notification**
  - Sends alert when an object is detected under 10 cm

- ðŸ“‚ **CSV Data Logging**
  - Logs distance, angle, timestamp, and object status

## ðŸ§  Software Components

- **Arduino IDE** for hardware control
- **Python (telegram_alert.py)** for sending Telegram messages
- **CSV Logger** for recording real-time sensor data
- **Graphical Visualization** (processing.py / GUI frontend)

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Ultrasonic sensor scans for objects using sound waves.
2. Based on distance:
   - LEDs and buzzer provide real-time alerts.
   - Data is logged in a CSV file.
3. If the distance is less than 10 cm:
   - A Telegram bot sends an alert to the user instantly.
4. The closest object is visually highlighted on the radar.
